# wikihow-GOSC
This is the code repository associated with the paper in submission < Goal-Oriented Script Construction >. 

## Get started

### Environment

`environment.yml` specifies the conda environment needed running the code. You can create the environment using it according to [this guildeline](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).

Note that the yml file might be overkilling, since it also contains dependencies we used for other parts of the project. You might only need a few essential packages (e.g. transformers) to run the code in this repo.

### Data

Sample data can be downloaded from [here]().

### Pretrained models

The pretrained models can be downloaded from [here](https://gofile.io/d/Yk9QII) (Passcode:wikihowgosc).



## Usage

### Further finetuning pretrained models


### Evaluating models


### Generating scripts with trained models
